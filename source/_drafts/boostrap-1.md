关注bootstrap辣么多年，总算要写点东西了。

# Bootstrap for responsive

talk about this, it's the first framework that i paid so much attention. For more than 3 years I've been focused on it, and since the day i started doing this job, I've token it as a guideline or guide book about how to develop a frame of websites——although we all know that there is no too much framework to build and rebuild is a waste of time in this era wheels are every where. Still I follow it here, until one day I'm going to use it in my programme, It's time to read and record.
